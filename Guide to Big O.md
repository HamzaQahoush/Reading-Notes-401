### Big O notation 
is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

### Degree of growth : 
O(1)
O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.


O(N)
O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 

O(N²)
O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set


O(2^N)
O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2^N) function is exponential .


### algorithm
 It is a procedure or formula used for solving a problem. It is based on conducting a sequence of specified actions in which these
 actions describe how to do something, and your computer will do it exactly that way every time
