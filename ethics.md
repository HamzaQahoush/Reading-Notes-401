## Understand What Ethics Is (and What It Isn’t)
As programmers, we all started somewhere. For some of us, it was tinkering with bits of code and dabbling in online coursework to learn how things worked. For others, it was in a university, struggling with assignments and working toward a computer science degree. No matter the path, the one commonality we (almost) all share is that nobody took the time to teach us about ethics.
If you ask almost any programmer if they’ve run into ethical issues in their work, they’re likely to say no. If you’re more specific though—like asking if an employer has ever asked them to forego unit testing in the interest of time or if they’ve felt pressure to misrepresent the status of some part of a project to a client—and the answer you’ll get is likely to change.


## Don’t Cover Up the Lapses of Others
Since programming tends to be an iterative process, it’s not uncommon to work on projects that involve building on or extending existing code. When doing so, we all have our head-scratching moments when we encounter things that range from the confusing to the completely outrageous. Sometimes, we’ll find sloppy code. Other times, we’ll see things that are just, well, wrong.

## Don’t Be Afraid To Say No
Programmers, and especially the independent variety, make their living moving from project to project. That brings with it a certain urgency to take on whatever work comes along no matter what it is. Needless to say, that can lead to a variety of ethical conflicts. After all, freelance programmers often don’t know all of the specifics of what they’re going to be working on until they’re knee-deep in code


## Pledge To Do Your Best
Although there aren’t many professional organizations for programmers to join that provide an ethical framework to follow, there are some published pledges that can serve as basic words to live by for the average programmer. A more in-depth resource that makes a fantastic guidebook is Robert Martin’s book The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers. It’s filled with plenty of actionable advice that can help any programmer to embrace ethical practices and to elevate their craft. They’re both excellent places to start.


## Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.
Developing new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts creates value for society, and those who expend this effort should expect to gain value from their work. Computing professionals should therefore credit the creators of ideas, inventions, work, and artifacts, and respect copyrights, patents, trade secrets, license agreements, and other methods of protecting authors' works.

Both custom and the law recognize that some exceptions to a creator's control of a work are necessary for the public good. Computing professionals should not unduly oppose reasonable uses of their intellectual works. Efforts to help others by contributing time and energy to projects that help society illustrate a positive aspect of this principle. Such efforts include free and open source software and work put into the public domain. Computing professionals should not claim private ownership of work that they or others have shared as public resources.

## Honor confidentiality.
Computing professionals are often entrusted with confidential information such as trade secrets, client data, nonpublic business strategies, financial information, research data, pre-publication scholarly articles, and patent applications. Computing professionals should protect confidentiality except in cases where it is evidence of the violation of law, of organizational regulations, or of the Code. In these cases, the nature or contents of that information should not be disclosed except to appropriate authorities. A computing professional should consider thoughtfully whether such disclosures are consistent with the Code.
