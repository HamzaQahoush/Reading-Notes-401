# Read  18 Cryptography :

Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it. 
The prefix  "crypt-" means "hidden" or "vault" -- and the suffix "-graphy" stands for "writing."

### Three types of cryptographic techniques used in general.

1. Symmetric-key cryptography : Both the sender and receiver share a single key

2. Hash functions  : o key is used in this algorithm. A fixed-length hash value is computed as per the plain text that makes it impossible

3. Public-key cryptography : (public and private key) are used. Public key may be freely distributed, while its paired private key, remains a secret.
 The public key is used for encryption and for decryption private key is used.



### Caesar Cipher
One of the earliest encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher, invented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago to communicate messages to his allies.
The Caesar Cipher is a great introduction to encryption, decryption, and code cracking, thanks to its simplicity.
Encrypting a message

Imagine Caesar wants to send this message:
SECRET MEETING AT THE PALACE

Here's what that might look like encrypted:

The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount.
